# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Backend Documentation

## 📌 Overview
The **Airbnb Clone** is a backend application designed to mimic the core functionality of Airbnb.  
It will provide a **RESTful API (or GraphQL)** that handles:

- User accounts  
- Property listings  
- Booking reservations  
- Payment processing  

This documentation phase focuses on creating a **blueprint for the system**, covering everything from high-level feature lists to low-level API specifications **before a single line of code is written**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this documentation project, you will learn how to:

- Translate project requirements into a structured list of features and functionalities.  
- Model system interactions visually using **Use Case Diagrams** to identify actors and their goals.  
- Articulate user needs by writing clear **User Stories** that guide development from a user-centric perspective.  
- Map data movement through the system using **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**.  
- Detail specific processes with **Flowcharts** to define logical sequences and decision points.  
- Write precise technical specifications that define API endpoints, data validation, and system behavior for developers.  
- Utilize **diagramming tools (e.g., Draw.io)** to create professional and clear technical diagrams.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts
- **Backend Architecture**: Structure of routers, controllers, models, and services.  
- **RESTful API Design**: Endpoints with proper HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) and status codes.  
- **Data Modeling**: Designing schemas (PostgreSQL / MongoDB) for `Users`, `Properties`, `Bookings`, etc.  
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implementing **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for AuthN & AuthZ.  
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Using third-party services like **Stripe or PayPal**.  
- **Documentation**: Writing clear and maintainable project specifications.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries
- **Draw.io / Diagrams.net** → Create Use Case, DFDs, Flowcharts  
- **Git & GitHub** → Version control and repo hosting  
- **Markdown** → Lightweight formatting for documentation  
- **Node.js & Express.js (Potential)** → Backend runtime & framework  
- **Database (Potential)** → PostgreSQL (Relational) / MongoDB (NoSQL)  
- **Authentication (Potential)** → bcrypt (password hashing), jsonwebtoken (JWTs)  
- **Payments (Potential)** → Stripe API SDK

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case
This documentation simulates the **initial phases of a real-world SDLC** (Software Development Lifecycle).  

Before coding, teams typically produce:  

- **Product Requirements Doc (PRD)** → Feature list (**Task 0**)  
- **System Design Mockups** → Use Case & DFD diagrams (**Tasks 1 & 3**)  
- **Agile/Scrum Backlog Items** → User Stories (**Task 2**)  
- **Technical Specifications** → API and requirement docs (**Task 5**)  

✅ This ensures alignment across the team, reduces errors, and creates a clear development roadmap.
